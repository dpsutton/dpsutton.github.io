The extent to which an insane person is liabile for torts has not been fully defined in this commonwealth.

An insane person may not be able to form malice

"the ability of the defendant to understand the particular act in question or to make a reasoned decision with respect to it, although it is sometimes said that an insane person is not liable for torts requiring malice of which he is incapable."
</p>

<p>
Contrasts to "general modern theory that liability in tort should rest upon fault".
</p>

<p>
"In so far as a particular intent would be necessary in order to render a normal person liable, the insane person, in order to be liable, must have been capable of entertaining that same  intent and must have entertained it in fact. But the law will not inquire further into his peculiar mental condition with a view to excusing him if it hsould appear that delusion or other consequences of his affliction has caused him to entertain that intent or that a normal person would not have entertained it."

"In a loose and general sense, the meaning of "intent" is easy to grasp. As Holmes observed, eve na dog knows the difference between being tripped over and being kicked. This is also the key distinction between two major divisions of legal liability&#x2013;negligence and intentional torts&#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
"the mere knowledge and appreciation of risk&#x2013;something short of substantial certainty&#x2013;is not intent. &#x2026; The line has to be drawn by the courts at the point where the known danger ceases to be only a foreseeable risk which a reasonable person would avoid, and becomes in the mind of the actor a substantial certainty."
</p>

<p>
"The intent with which tort liability is concerned is not necessarily a hostile intent or a desire to do any harm. Rather it is an intent to bring about a result which will invade the interest of aonther in a way that the law forbigs".

Definitely an intentional tort, question is is it consented to by playing football. Lower court ruled that it was since football is a special kind of "warfare" (crazy terminology).
</p>

<p>
"[D]efendant .. admitted that the blow which had been struck was not accidental, that it was intentionally administered, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that the game of professional football is basically a business which is violent in nature, and that the available sanctions are imposition of penalties and expulsion from the game. Notice was taken of the fact that many fouls are overlooked; that the game is played in an emotional and noisy environment; and that incidents such as that here complained of are not unusual."

<p>
"In sum, having concluded that the trial court did not limit the case to a trial of the evidence bearing on defendant's liability but rather determined that as a matter of social policy the game was so violent and unlawful that valid lines could not be drawn, we take the view that this was not a proper issue for determination and that plaintiff was entitled to have the case tried on an assessment of his rights and whether they had been violated".
